	In Util v1.41
	add inet_pton, inet_ntop, AF_INET, AF_INET6

	modify inet_n2dx and inet_n2ad to
	recognize the new 128 bit IPv4 format

	point-to-point networks as described in RFC 3021

	NOTE: for /31's and /127's

4.037 Fri Nov 19 10:48:01 PST 2010

	thanks to Steve Huff (SHUFF) * shuff@cpan.org for 
	spotting that bug.

	In Lite.pm v1.22, update t/v4-new.t for deprecated array syntax in 
	perl 5.13

	is:     (qw(...stuff...))

	thanks to Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> for reporting this

4.035 Thu Oct 28 14:26:19 PDT 2010
	fix bug in Lite v1.21 where new6 improperly assigns the mask value 
	for and ipv4 address in 32 bit space instead of 128 bit space

	Thanks to Mark Martinec and Steve Huff (SHUFF) * shuff@cpan.org

	Returned object list can be split from bottom to top
	or from top to bottom depending on which method is called

		split, rsplit, splitref, rsplitref

	Thanks to kashmish <kashmish@gmail.com> for the idea on
	improving functionality of 'split'.

	Zeros and Zero both will work

  in Lite v1.12
	added minus (-) overloading to allow the subtraction
	of two NetAddr::IP objects to get the difference between

	Thanks to Rob Riepel <riepel@networking.Stanford.EDU>
	for the initial code and inspiration for this enhancement

4.016  Wed Nov  5 18:13:20 PST 2008

	in Lite.pm v1.11, add test for characters not allowed by
	rfc952 before the call to gethostbyname in sub new() for those
	people that insist on using deprecated functionality :aton
	and OS's that fail to notice calls to gethostbyname with
	binary arguments.

4.013  Wed Oct 22 15:04:49 PDT 2008
	In Lite.pm v1.10, add new no octal method for
	improperly formatted ipV4 addresses

4.011  released Oct 6 13:10

4.010  Sat Sep 27 17:00:28 PDT 2008
    in NetAddr::IP::Util v0.19
	updated test for ENDIANess in siteconf

	add test in inet_aton to detect overange IP dot quad values
	missed by some broken Socket implementations
	i.e. 256.1.1.1 would fail to return undef

NOTE: 	Versions 4.008 and 4.009 had limited release to tester only
	and were not uploaded to CPAN. All of the v4.008, 4.009
	changes are incorporated in v4.010

4.009  Tue Sep  2 19:09:57 PDT 2008
	In NetAddr::IP::Lite v1.07,
	in the off chance that NetAddr::IP::Lite objects are created
	and the caller later loads NetAddr::IP and expects to use
	those objects, let the AUTOLOAD routine find and redirect
	NetAddr::IP::Lite method and subroutine calls to NetAddr::IP.

	updated Lite/t/v4-wnew.t so that non-existent
	domains are "really" not there

4.008  Sat Jun  7 14:01:55 PDT 2008
	inherit method "new_from_aton" from NetAddr::IP::Lite
	add related documentation

      Inherited methods from Lite.pm updated as follows:

	comparisons of the form <, >, <=, >=
		10.0.0.0/24 {operator} 10.0.0.0/16
	return now return the comparison of the cidr value
	when the address portion is equal.
NOTE:	this comparison returns the comparison of the NUMERIC
	value of the CIDR. This produces the counter intuitive result
	that /24 > /16. There is logic to this, really! For proper
	operation of commands like "Compact" and "Coalesce", lists of
	netaddr objects must sort in ascending order. However, this
	conflicts with the requirement for larger netblocks to sort
	FIRST so as to include smaller ones. This logic extends to
	any requirement for a sort of netaddr objects. It should be
	further noted that the mixing of netaddr objects with varying
	IP addresses and CIDR allocations can lead to unexpected
	results since the comparisons done first on the IP portion
	and then on the CIDR portion. The documentation has been
	updated appropriately.
	Thanks to Peter DeVries for spotting this discrepancy
