1.50  Tue Apr  9 12:02:34 PDT 2013

	with 'gcc', try building with 'cc', and check again.
	If config.h is not found, force Pure Perl mode.

1.45  Fri Nov 11 13:20:32 PST 2011
	break out the code in InetBase v0.05 that expands short IPv4 
	addresses into dotquad format to account for broken BSD 
	implementations of inet_aton and gethostbyname that do 
	not recognize the short format. EXPORT this as sub 'fillIPv4'

	in Util.pm, add 'fillIPv4' to calls to gethostbyname to 
	work around broken inet_aton and gethostbyname implementations
	in certain BSD implementations

	add inet_pton, inet_ntop, AF_INET, AF_INET6

	modify inet_n2dx and inet_n2ad to 
	recognize the new 128 bit IPv4 format
	::FFFF:FFFF:0:0

	split the following into NetAddr::IP::InetBase v0.01
	to provide better long term support for IPv6

        inet_ntoa
        ipv6_aton
        ipv6_n2x
        ipv6_n2d

        inet_ntop
        inet_pton
        packzeros
        isIPv4
        isNewIPv4
        isAnyIPv4

1.35  Tue Nov 16 16:28:37 PST 2010
	naip_gethostbyname modified to return undef instead of 
	0 (zero) on failure

	thanks to Terry Cassidy enaudishaylee@tc17.com for the bug report

	move sub's ipv6_n2d and ipv6_n2x to non-autosplit portion
	of module to eliminate warnings during autosplit of "our" variables

        *a++ = to *a and added increment after save to mollify some
        picky compilers that return possible undefined behavior.

1.31  Tue Jun  9 10:31:11 PDT 2009
	ferret out shell value for Makefile.PL when calling

1.27  Tue Dec  9 12:00:08 PST 2008
	revised UtilPP v1.7 to work around perl 5.8.4 
	failures with certain @_ operations of goto &sub...

	libraries against the perl build for consistency

1.23  Sun Nov  2 10:10:38 PST 2008

	clear build bug for Win32

	add test in inet_aton to detect overange IP dot quad values
	missed by some broken Socket implementations
	i.e. 256.1.1.1

	for spotting those bugs

0.15  Tue Jun 13 14:42:34 PDT 2006
	UtilPP.pm v0.07 & Util.xs 'shiftleft' so that the original
	argument is returned when the shift count is '0' or missing

0.14  Tue Jun  6 08:37:01 PDT 2006
	add logic to check LIBS => [-lfiles]
	individually. ExtUtils::xxx does a bad job and
	leaves libs that do not exist in the list
	which causes 'siteconf' to blow up on missing libs
	on perl 5.053 (and probably others)

0.13  Tue Jun  6 08:33:11 PDT 2006
	added to xs file, 'hopefully' to allow build on windoze platforms

0.12  Tue Jun  6 08:21:12 PDT 2006

	are not used in PurePerl mode

	add site configuration to supply u_intxx_t vars
	for Sun OS and others that don't have them

	UtilPP.pm v0.06, removed unnecessary pack(unpack) sequences
	to speed up ipv4->6, ipv6->4 conversions

0.08  Wed Apr 26 18:33:12 PDT 2006
	correct documentation error
	add ipv6to4

	initial release
